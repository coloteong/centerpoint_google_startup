# CenterPoint: Set up your next meeting with ease
This is our project submission for the Google Startups Hackathon in Singapore. 
Our project aims to help users find the closest location for meetups for people located in different places.

#### Note: Please input your own Google API key. For documentation on how to get your own Google API key: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key
1. Make a virtual environment for the project, either conda or venv, and then run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all packages needed.
2. `cd frontend/` and then `npm install` to download all dependencies for the frontend.
3. While in the `frontend` dir, run `npm run dev` to compile all frontend scripts.
4. In another terminal window, `cd flask_app` and then `python3 app.py` to start the Flask server.
After that, the URL should be listed in the terminal and clicking on the URL should lead you to the working application.
